# Iterate on PR Until CI Passes

Continuously iterate on the current branch until all CI checks pass and review feedback is addressed.

**Requires**: GitHub CLI (`gh`) or GitLab CLI (`glab`) authenticated and available.

## Options

**Flags:**
- `--fixup` - Use fixup commits to amend existing branch commits instead of creating new commits. Requires force push. Orphan files (not touched by any branch commit, including files last modified on the base branch) are committed as new.
- `--no-consolidate` - Skip the consolidation prompt after CI passes. Use for scripting or when you want to keep `[FIX PIPELINE]` commits separate.

---

## Step 0: Detect Platform

Determine whether this is a GitHub or GitLab repository:

```bash
git remote -v | head -1
```

- If remote contains `github.com` → use **GitHub** commands
- If remote contains `gitlab.com` or other GitLab instance → use **GitLab** commands

---

## GitHub Flow

### Step 1: Identify the PR

```bash
gh pr view --json number,url,headRefName,baseRefName
```

If no PR exists for the current branch, stop and inform the user.

### Step 2: Check CI Status First

```bash
gh pr checks --json name,state,bucket,link,workflow
```

The `bucket` field categorizes state into: `pass`, `fail`, `pending`, `skipping`, or `cancel`.

**Important:** If any of these checks are still `pending`, wait before proceeding:
- `sentry` / `sentry-io`
- `codecov`
- `cursor` / `bugbot` / `seer`
- Any linter or code analysis checks

These bots may post additional feedback comments once their checks complete. Waiting avoids duplicate work.

### Step 3: Gather Review Feedback

**Review Comments and Status:**
```bash
gh pr view --json reviews,comments,reviewDecision
```

**Inline Code Review Comments:**
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments
```

**PR Conversation Comments (includes bot comments):**
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr_number}/comments
```

### Step 4: Investigate Failures

```bash
# List recent runs for this branch
gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 5 --json databaseId,name,status,conclusion

# View failed logs for a specific run
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

Do NOT assume what failed based on the check name alone. Always read the actual logs.

### Step 5-7: Fix, Commit, Push

See common steps below.

### Step 8: Wait for CI

```bash
gh pr checks --watch --interval 30
```

This waits until all checks complete. Exit code 0 means all passed, exit code 1 means failures.

---

## GitLab Flow

### Step 1: Identify the PR

**Using GitLab MCP server (preferred if available):**
```
mcp__gitlab__get_merge_request with source_branch: <current-branch>
```

**Using glab CLI:**
```bash
glab mr view --web=false
```

**Using glab to list PRs for current branch:**
```bash
glab mr list --source-branch=$(git branch --show-current)
```

If no PR exists for the current branch, stop and inform the user.

### Step 2: Check CI Status First

**Using GitLab MCP server (preferred):**
```
mcp__gitlab__list_pipelines with ref: <current-branch>
mcp__gitlab__get_pipeline with pipeline_id: <id>
mcp__gitlab__list_pipeline_jobs with pipeline_id: <id>
```

**Using glab CLI:**
```bash
# View pipeline status for current branch
glab ci status

# List recent pipelines
glab ci list --branch $(git branch --show-current)

# View specific pipeline
glab ci view <pipeline-id>
```

Pipeline statuses: `created`, `waiting_for_resource`, `preparing`, `pending`, `running`, `success`, `failed`, `canceled`, `skipped`, `manual`, `scheduled`.

**Important:** If pipeline is still `running` or `pending`, wait before proceeding.

### Step 3: Gather Review Feedback

**Using GitLab MCP server (preferred):**
```
mcp__gitlab__get_merge_request with merge_request_iid: <iid>
mcp__gitlab__mr_discussions with merge_request_iid: <iid>
```

**Using glab CLI:**
```bash
# View PR details including approval status
glab mr view <mr-iid>

# View PR notes/comments
glab mr note list <mr-iid>
```

### Step 4: Investigate Failures

**Using GitLab MCP server (preferred):**
```
mcp__gitlab__list_pipeline_jobs with pipeline_id: <id>, scope: "failed"
mcp__gitlab__get_pipeline_job_output with job_id: <id>
```

**Using glab CLI:**
```bash
# List jobs in a pipeline
glab ci list --pipeline <pipeline-id>

# View job log (trace)
glab ci trace <job-id>

# Or view the entire pipeline's failed jobs
glab ci view <pipeline-id> --web=false
```

Do NOT assume what failed based on the job name alone. Always read the actual logs.

### Step 5-7: Fix, Commit, Push

See common steps below.

### Step 8: Wait for CI

**Using glab CLI:**
```bash
# Watch pipeline status
glab ci status --live

# Or poll manually
glab ci status --branch $(git branch --show-current)
```

---

## Common Steps (Both Platforms)

### Step 5: Validate Feedback

For each piece of feedback (CI failure or review comment):

1. **Read the relevant code** - Understand the context before making changes
2. **Verify the issue is real** - Not all feedback is correct; reviewers and bots can be wrong
3. **Check if already addressed** - The issue may have been fixed in a subsequent commit
4. **Skip invalid feedback** - If the concern is not legitimate, move on

### Step 6: Address Valid Issues

Make minimal, targeted code changes. Only fix what is actually broken.

### Step 7: Commit and Push

**If `--fixup` mode is enabled:** See Step 7b (Fixup Commit Flow) below.

**Default (no flag):**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "[FIX PIPELINE] <descriptive message of what was fixed>"
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

The `[FIX PIPELINE]` prefix marks commits as iteration fixes, making them easy to identify and consolidate later (see Step 10).

### Step 7b: Fixup Commit Flow (when `--fixup` is enabled)

**Goal:** Amend existing branch commits instead of adding new commits, keeping history clean during iteration.

#### 7b.1: Determine Base Branch (from PR)

Use the PR's base branch from Step 1 so fixups stay scoped to the actual target branch.

```bash
# GitHub
BASE=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName)
```

```bash
# GitLab (glab CLI — preferred)
BASE=$(glab mr view --json target_branch --jq .target_branch)
```

```bash
# GitLab MCP (alternative if glab is unavailable)
# Use target_branch from mcp__gitlab__get_merge_request
```

If the PR base branch can't be determined, fall back to `origin/HEAD`, then `main`, then `master`.

```bash
if [ -z "$BASE" ]; then
  BASE=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')
fi
if [ -z "$BASE" ]; then
  if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/main; then
    BASE=main
  else
    BASE=master
  fi
fi
BASE_REF="origin/$BASE"
```

Before using `BASE_REF`, ensure the remote ref exists and is up to date:

```bash
git fetch origin $BASE
git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/$BASE
```

If the ref is missing, re-run base detection or `git fetch origin` and try again.

#### 7b.2: Map Changed Files to Commits

For each changed file (from `git diff --name-only`, `git diff --cached --name-only`, and untracked files from `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`), find which branch commit last touched it:

```bash
git log $BASE_REF..HEAD -n 1 --format=%H -- <file_path>
```

Combine and de-dupe those file lists before mapping. Group files by their target commit SHA. Files with no matching commit are "orphans" (files not touched by any branch commit, including files last modified on the base branch).

#### 7b.3: Create Fixup Commits

For each target commit (from the mapping):

```bash
git add -A -- <matched_files...>
git commit --fixup=<commit_sha>
```

#### 7b.4: Handle Orphan Files

If any files were not touched by branch commits (orphans), create a regular commit for them:

```bash
git add -A -- <orphan_files...>
git commit -m "<descriptive message of what was fixed>"
```

#### 7b.5: Autosquash Rebase

```bash
GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true git rebase -i --autosquash $BASE_REF
```

**If rebase fails (conflicts):**

1. Abort the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --abort
   ```
2. Log a warning:
   > "Autosquash rebase failed due to conflicts. Falling back to regular commit mode for this iteration. The fixup commits remain on the branch and can be manually squashed later."
3. Fall back to regular commit (Step 7 default behavior) for any remaining uncommitted changes
4. Continue to push step

#### 7b.6: Push with Force

After successful rebase (or fallback), push with force:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

**Note:** `--force-with-lease` is required because the rebase rewrites history. It refuses to overwrite remote commits you haven't fetched, but you should still coordinate with other contributors before forcing.

### Step 9: Repeat

Return to Step 2 if:
- Any CI checks failed
- New review feedback appeared

Continue until all checks pass and no unaddressed feedback remains.

---

### Step 10: Consolidation Phase (Default Mode Only)

**Skip this step if:** `--fixup` mode was used, or `--no-consolidate` flag is set.

When all CI checks pass and no unaddressed feedback remains, offer to consolidate the `[FIX PIPELINE]` commits into the original branch commits.

#### Step 10.1: Detect [FIX PIPELINE] Commits

Determine the base branch (reuse logic from Step 7b.1) and find pipeline fix commits:

```bash
# GitHub
BASE=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName)

# GitLab
BASE=$(glab mr view --json target_branch --jq .target_branch)

BASE_REF="origin/$BASE"
git fetch origin $BASE

# Find [FIX PIPELINE] commits
FIX_COMMITS=$(git log $BASE_REF..HEAD --format="%H %s" | grep "\[FIX PIPELINE\]")
```

If no `[FIX PIPELINE]` commits exist, skip to success exit.

#### Step 10.2: Prompt for Consolidation

Present the user with a summary:

```
CI checks passed! Found N [FIX PIPELINE] commits:

  abc1234 [FIX PIPELINE] Fix lint errors in user-service.ts
  def5678 [FIX PIPELINE] Add missing test assertion
  ghi9012 [FIX PIPELINE] Update dependency version

Would you like to consolidate these into the original branch commits?

Options:
  1. Yes - Consolidate now (rewrites history, requires force push)
  2. No - Keep separate commits (can squash-merge the PR later)
```

**If user selects "No":**
```
Keeping [FIX PIPELINE] commits as separate commits.

Tip: When merging the PR, consider using "Squash and merge" to combine all commits.
Alternatively, run /kramme:recreate-commits to rewrite the branch later.
```
Exit successfully.

#### Step 10.2.1: Ask Rebase Mode (Claude Code)

Use Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask how consolidation should proceed:

- **Option A (Automated):** Fully automated consolidation (no editor). The agent will create `fixup!` commits and run autosquash with `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true`.
- **Option B (Interactive):** Interactive rebase. The agent will launch `git rebase -i` without `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true` so the user can drop/move `[FIX PIPELINE]` commits.

If the user chooses **Automated**, continue with Steps 10.3–10.8.
If the user chooses **Interactive**, skip directly to Step 10.6 and run the rebase interactively.

#### Step 10.3: Map Files to Original Commits

For each `[FIX PIPELINE]` commit, get the files it changed and map them to original commits:

```bash
# Get files changed in this [FIX PIPELINE] commit
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r $FIX_COMMIT_SHA)

# For each file, find the most recent non-[FIX PIPELINE] commit
for FILE in $CHANGED_FILES; do
  ORIGINAL_COMMIT=$(git log $BASE_REF..HEAD --format="%H %s" -- "$FILE" | \
    grep -v "\[FIX PIPELINE\]" | \
    head -1 | \
    cut -d' ' -f1)

  if [ -n "$ORIGINAL_COMMIT" ]; then
    # Map file to original commit
    echo "$ORIGINAL_COMMIT:$FILE"
  else
    # Mark as orphan (file only exists in [FIX PIPELINE] commits)
    echo "orphan:$FILE"
  fi
done
```

Group files by their target original commit.

#### Step 10.4: Create Fixup Commits

For each target original commit:

```bash
git add <files_targeting_this_commit>
git commit --fixup=<original_commit_sha>
```

#### Step 10.5: Handle Orphan Files

If any files have no matching original commit (orphans), create a regular commit:

```bash
git add <orphan_files>
git commit -m "Pipeline fixes for new files"
```

#### Step 10.6: Autosquash Rebase

```bash
GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true git rebase -i --autosquash $BASE_REF
```

**If rebase fails (conflicts):**

1. Abort the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --abort
   ```

2. Inform user:
   > "Consolidation failed due to conflicts. Your `[FIX PIPELINE]` commits are preserved on the branch."
   >
   > "Options:"
   > - Resolve manually: `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true git rebase -i --autosquash $BASE_REF`
   > - Keep commits as-is and squash-merge the PR
   > - Run `/kramme:recreate-commits` for a complete rewrite

3. Exit without force push

#### Step 10.7: Force Push

After successful rebase:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

#### Step 10.8: Confirm Success

```
Successfully consolidated [FIX PIPELINE] commits!

Updated commit history:
  abc1234 Original feature implementation (now includes pipeline fixes)
  def5678 Add tests (now includes pipeline fixes)

The [FIX PIPELINE] changes have been absorbed into the original commits.
```

## Exit Conditions

**Success:**
- All CI checks are green
- No unaddressed human review feedback
- (Default mode) Consolidation completed or user chose to keep separate commits

**Ask for Help:**
- Same failure persists after 3 attempts (likely a flaky test or deeper issue)
- Review feedback requires clarification or decision from the user
- CI failure is unrelated to branch changes (infrastructure issue)
- Consolidation rebase failed due to conflicts (user must resolve manually)

**Stop Immediately:**
- No PR exists for the current branch
- Branch is out of sync and needs rebase (inform user)

---

## Tips

**GitHub:**
- Use `gh pr checks --required` to focus only on required checks
- Use `gh run view <run-id> --verbose` to see all job steps, not just failures
- If a check is from an external service, the `link` field provides the URL

**GitLab:**
- Use `glab ci retry <job-id>` to retry a single failed job
- Use `glab ci run` to trigger a new pipeline manually
- Check for `allow_failure: true` jobs that don't block the pipeline
- Use the GitLab MCP server tools when available for richer data access

**Default Mode (New Commits):**
- Creates commits with `[FIX PIPELINE]` prefix for easy identification
- No force push during iteration (safer for collaborators watching the PR)
- After CI passes, offers to consolidate `[FIX PIPELINE]` commits into original commits
- Use `--no-consolidate` to skip the consolidation prompt
- Alternative: Use "Squash and merge" in GitHub/GitLab to combine all commits when merging

**Fixup Mode (`--fixup`):**
- Use when you want to keep commit history clean during PR iteration
- Orphan files (files not touched by any existing branch commit, including files last modified on the base branch) become new commits automatically
- If rebase conflicts occur, the iteration continues with a regular commit
- Uses `--force-with-lease` for a safer force push after rebase (still requires coordination and an up-to-date fetch)

**Choosing a Mode:**
- **Default**: Working with others, want visible iteration history, prefer to consolidate at the end
- **`--fixup`**: Working alone, want clean history throughout, comfortable with force push
