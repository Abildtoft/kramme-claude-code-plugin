# Remove AI Code Slop

This command uses the `kramme:deslop-reviewer` agent to identify AI slop, then fixes the identified issues.

## Process

1. **Scan for slop**
   - Launch `kramme:deslop-reviewer` in code review mode
   - Detect the base branch and get the diff:
     ```bash
     BASE_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')
     [ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && BASE_BRANCH=$(git branch -r | grep -E 'origin/(main|master)$' | head -1 | sed 's@.*origin/@@')
     git diff origin/$BASE_BRANCH...HEAD
     ```
   - Agent identifies slop patterns in changed files

2. **Review findings**
   - Present the slop findings to understand what will be changed
   - Findings include file:line references and explanations

3. **Fix identified slop**
   - For each slop finding, edit the file to remove the pattern:
     - Remove unnecessary comments
     - Remove excessive defensive checks/try-catch blocks
     - Replace `any` casts with proper types where possible
     - Align style with the rest of the file

4. **Report summary**
   - Provide a 1-3 sentence summary of what was changed
   - List files that were modified

## Slop Patterns (Quick Reference)

- **Unnecessary comments**: Comments describing obvious code or over-documenting
- **Defensive overkill**: Try-catch/null checks where not needed
- **Type workarounds**: `any` casts, `@ts-ignore` without justification
- **Style inconsistencies**: Different patterns than the rest of the file
- **Over-engineering**: Unnecessary abstractions for simple operations
